Hedges Chatter is intended for use on the Discord platform. By using Hedges Chatter, you
 agree to comply with Discord's terms of service and community 
guidelines. By using Hedges Chatter, you also agree to our terms of service, and our [privacy policy](https://github.com/hdevelopments/hdev-discord-chat-sync/blob/main/privacy.md).

The bot syncs only User generated text! \
The Bot doesnt generate any content. It broadcasts User generated content and because of that, every content in any way or form is the original owners property. \
We dont take any responsibility of what a user "broadcasts" over any synchronized channels! We will take actions to hinder any further TOS breaking by either blocking messages from that User or the whole Guild!

Everyone using Hedges Chatter must comply with those rules!
